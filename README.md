I have opted to start with using c++/winRT. I dont have experience with different frontend technologies as I have always worked in an in-house engine. 
I have used the c++/winRT in the test in January and decided I wanted to try to make this test within this wireframe and challenge myself to get this prototype fully functional within the time constraint of 2h-4h.

**Dependencies**
I work with a visual studio project, runable from visual studio. It is important to have all the dependencies for c++/winRT correctly installed (Visual sudio Extension and NuGet package)

**How to use the program**
The program will be runable from visual studio and will boot up the character select screen immediatly
