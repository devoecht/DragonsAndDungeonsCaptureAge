# DragonsAndDungeonsCaptureAge

I have opted to start with using c++/winRT. I dont have experience with different frontend technologies as I have always worked in an in-house engine. 
I have used the c++/winRT in the test in January and decided I wanted to try to make this test within this wireframe and challenge myself to get this prototype fully functional within the time constraint of 2h-4h.

**Dependencies**
I work with a visual studio project, runable from visual studio. It is important to have all the dependencies for c++/winRT correctly installed (Visual sudio Extension and NuGet package)

**How to use the program**
The program will be runable from visual studio and will boot up the character select screen immediatly



**Note after 4h**

I didnt manage to finish this test my apologies. I wasn't familiar enough with C++/WinRT and thought I could do it in 4h with learning this framework more. 
I will make a branch in this repository as I still want to continue working on this in my own time to figure out to make this completely working. 

I would like to thank you for your time with the interviews and for giving me this oportunity.
